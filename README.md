# C++ Practice Playground

This repository contains practical exercises to practice C++ standard 14.
This section is for theoretical programs.For project-oriented programs, see the other repo `Programming_Projects_Java`.
Feel free to explore each file for code examples and explanations.

## Chapter 1: Section 1.2 Expressions

- [Cpp vs Java](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_0_0_Cpp_vs_Java.cpp) - Explains differences between Java and C\+\+ handling of `char`/`byte` and Unicode.
- [Greetings](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_0_1_Greetings.cpp) - Simple greeting program that asks how many languages the user has used and responds conditionally.
- [Deposit](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_0_2_Deposit.cpp) - Reads a deposit amount and computes the balance after one year with a fixed interest rate.
1. [Declarations](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_1.cpp) - Shows two ways to declare and initialize `feet` and `inches` variables.
2. [Declarations double](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_2.cpp) - Shows two ways to declare and initialize `count` (int) and `distance` (double).
3. [Uninitialized Variables](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_3.cpp) - Demonstrates undefined/garbage values from uninitialized local variables and explains behavior.
4. [Expressions Examples](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_4_Expressions.cpp) - Converts simple mathematical formulas into C\+\+ expressions with user input.
5. [Output Characters](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_5_Output.cpp) - Shows character assignments and outputs the resulting character sequence.
6. [Integer Division](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_6_Output.cpp) - Demonstrates integer-division pitfalls using `(1/3) * 3`.
7. [Quotient and Remainder](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_7_Output_and_remainder.cpp) - Reads two integers and prints the whole-number quotient and remainder.
8. [Temperature Conversion](1_Start/1.2_Expressions/1_8_Temperature_conversion.cpp) - Shows a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion bug due to integer division and the corrected expression.
