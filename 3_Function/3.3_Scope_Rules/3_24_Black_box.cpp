// When we say that a programmer should be able to treat a function like a black box,
// we mean that the programmer can use the function without needing to understand
// its internal workings or implementation details.
// The focus is on the function's interface, which includes its name,
// parameters, return type, and behavior (what it does),
// rather than how it achieves that behavior.
// This allows for abstraction, making it easier to use and reuse functions
// without getting bogged down in the complexities of their internal logic.
// Formally speaking:
// When we say that the programmer who uses a function should be able to treat the
// function like a black box, we mean the programmer should not need to look at
// the body of the function definition to see how the function works. The function
// declaration and accompanying comment should be all the programmer needs in
// order to use the function.
