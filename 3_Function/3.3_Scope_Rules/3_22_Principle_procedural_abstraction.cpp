/*
What is the purpose of the comment that accompanies a function declaration?
*/
// The comment explains the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
// It helps with information hiding and procedural abstraction, making the function
// to behave like a black box.
// Formally speaking:
// The principle of procedural abstraction says that a function should be written so
// that it can be used like a black box. This means that the programmer who uses
// the function needs not look at the body of the function definition to see how the
// function works. The function declaration and accompanying comment should be
// all the programmer needs in order to use the function.
