/*
What is the purpose of the comment that accompanies a function declaration?
*/
// The comment explains the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value.
// It helps with information hiding and procedural abstraction, making the function
// to behave like a black box.
// Formally:
// The comment explains what action the function takes, including any value returned,
// and gives any other information that you need to know in order to use the function.
